__dcbs cli music management
===========================

A collection of scripts & config files for handling my music collection

I rip all my CDs to FLAC and copy them to micro-sd cards for my Fiio X5.

These scripts & configs help me do it.

Environment
-----------

Set this up on Archlinux x86_64, all dependancy binaries are from arch (or yaourt) repos.

Dependencies
------------

abcde
some flac encoder package? almost certainly...
rsync


Ripping
-------

I use abcde, at time of writing I'm using v2.8.1
